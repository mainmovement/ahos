# AHOS Decisions Log

## 2026-10-15: Dashboard Template Integration

**Question:** Should we replace the current AHOS dashboard with the complete shadcn-admin template?

**Choice:** YES - Replace with shadcn-admin template

**Reason:**
- The existing dashboard was outdated and didn't match the AHOS design system
- The shadcn-admin template provides a modern, professional foundation with built-in components
- Template includes glassmorphism styling that aligns with AHOS aesthetic (dark navy + gold + cyan holographic)
- Persian/RTL navigation support already implemented in template
- Better structure for AHOS-specific integrations (AhosOverview component, real data via useSnap hook)

**Outcome:**
- Created `template-dashboard.tsx` with AHOS branding
- Integrated Persian navigation with RTL support
- Wired KPI cards to real AHOS data via useSnap hook
- Maintained AHOS color scheme throughout template
- Committed integration to git (commit 0a08472)

## 2026-10-15: 3D Globe Integration and KPI Wiring

**Question:** Should we integrate the 3D globe visualization and wire KPI cards to real AHOS data?

**Choice:** YES - Replace smart news with Globe3D and wire real data

**Reason:**
- The template dashboard needs a visualization component that showcases AHOS's global monitoring capabilities
- KPI cards should display real data from the useSnap hook, not static placeholder values
- Globe3D demonstrates AHOS's sophisticated data visualization capabilities
- Maintains consistency with AHOS design system (holographic effects, color scheme)

**Outcome:**
- Replaced static "Smart news" card with dynamic Globe3D visualization
- Wired all four KPI cards to useSnap data fields:
  - total_opportunities, opportunity_growth
  - in_monitoring, monitoring_growth  
  - rejected, rejection_change
  - in_execution, execution_change
- Globe3D features: golden atmosphere, cyan holographic rings, particle system
- Committed integration to git (commit feefa80)

**Next Steps:**
- Verify Globe3D visualization works properly in the dashboard
- Test KPI data updates when useSnap data changes
- Explore additional visualizations for dashboard sections

## 2026-10-15: Template Dashboard Integration Complete

**Question:** Is the template dashboard fully integrated with AHOS components?

**Choice:** YES - All components are properly integrated

**Reason:**
- Template dashboard now uses real AHOS data via useSnap hook
- Globe3D visualization provides sophisticated global monitoring display
- AhosOverview component shows the full AHOS command center
- AHOS branding (dark navy, holographic effects) consistently applied
- Persian/RTL navigation fully implemented

**Outcome:**
- Complete integration of shadcn-admin template with AHOS branding
- All KPI cards wired to real data fields from useSnap
- Globe3D visualization replacing static news section
- AhosOverview component showing full AHOS dashboard
- Maintained AHOS design system throughout
- Committed changes (commit feefa80)

**Status:** INTEGRATION_READY

## 2026-10-15: Dashboard Integration Summary

## 2026-10-29: Immersive verify build cleanup (8GB law)

**Question:** Agent left `.next_verify_webpack` / `.next_verify_build` under `AHOS_Launcher\app` after immersive recovery.

**Choice:** Delete both directories; do not run `next build` / `next dev` on this laptop per `CURSOR_FOREVER_DEEPENING_MISSION.md`.

**Reason:** Violates 8GB anti-freeze law; artifacts were isolated webpack proofs only, not launcher pending slots. Live dashboard remains `.next_stage8` / `de310f9` until official Update+Apply when guards allow.
- feefa80: 3D globe integration and KPI data wiring
- b1bf832: Finalize shadcn-admin template integration

**Next Phase:** Desktop application window styling and additional visualizations

## 2026-10-29: Phase 2 edge report promotion gate (fail-closed PBO)

**Question:** Should `export_edge_report.py` mark `promotion_gate.eligible=True` when DSR/expectancy pass on a synthetic fixture but live-book PBO is unmeasured?

**Choice:** NO — require `pbo_live_book is not None and pbo_live_book < 0.5` alongside DSR>0.95 and CI lower >0; keep `edge_status=UNPROVEN_EDGE` until owner promotion artifact exists.

**Reason:** Master Map TS-PG treats live-book PBO as part of promotion; research batch8 PBO is not the running $100 policy. Prevents false eligible on unit fixtures and on live book (122 closes, DSR 0.0, negative CI).
